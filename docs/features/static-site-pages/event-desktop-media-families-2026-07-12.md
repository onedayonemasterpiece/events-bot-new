# Desktop event media families — 2026-07-12

Status: **noindex desktop-only review lab; no layout is promoted to production**.

Public target: `https://kenigevents.ru/preview-20260712t-desktop-media-families/lab/event-desktop/`.

This round supersedes the decision logic of the six-option 2026-07-11 lab, but the old preview remains the rollback/reference surface. The production mobile hero-overlap composition is explicitly outside this change.

## Core split

The desktop renderer must not infer one crop rule from orientation alone.

| Media contract | Layout behavior | Crop contract |
|---|---|---|
| `visual_only` / no meaningful OCR | Treat as a photograph: build a strong hero, use the available canvas, use focal `object-position` when available. | `cover` is expected; assertive crop is allowed. |
| `ocr_text` | Treat as a document/poster: keep embedded date, venue, partners and conditions readable; allocate width from source ratio and viewport height. | `contain` by default. `cover` requires an explicit source-grounded/manual `safe_crop` decision **and** measured source-area loss `<=20%`; otherwise automatic fallback to `contain`. |
| `unknown` | Safety fallback until classification is reliable. | Follow OCR policy, not photo policy. |

The 20% limit is measured from actual frame and source geometry:

```text
scale = max(frameWidth / imageWidth, frameHeight / imageHeight)
visibleFraction = frameArea / (sourceArea * scale²)
cropFraction = 1 - visibleFraction
```

Geometry is only a limit, not evidence that edge text is safe. The lab therefore enables cover only when `data-ocr-safe-cover=true`; all other OCR specimens remain contained even when the geometric crop would be under 20%. The lab exposes `data-measured-crop` and `data-potential-cover-crop` for Playwright acceptance. It does not hide empty areas with blur, duplicated images, gradients or fake backdrops.

## Real corpus evidence

Audit source: `312` real event pages from `preview-20260711t-desktop-event-layouts`.

- `194` are `visual_only`, `113` are `ocr_text`, `5` are `unknown`.
- OCR orientation: `81` portrait, `18` landscape, `14` square.
- OCR title length: median `29` characters, P25 `19`, P75 `38`.
- For portrait OCR, `52/81` (`64.2%`) satisfy the provisional Typographic Lead gate: `<=35` characters and `<=5` words.

Conclusion: Typographic Lead is not a universal layout, but its eligible population is large enough for a deterministic branch. A title outside the gate routes to Gallery Exhibition or Split Canvas.

Representative real specimens:

- no OCR: `5658` stage photo, `5264` pianist photo, `6794` vertical ship photo, `6033` vertical submarine photo;
- OCR: `4671` dense square poster, `6345` portrait poster, `6510` square poster + long H1, `6661` portrait poster + one-word H1.

The corpus audit is a design sample, not a claim that `image_text_mode` is perfect. Known source-grounded classifier misses still require exporter/Smart Update repair; layout safety must fail toward OCR-safe treatment.

## Candidate matrix

Each surviving candidate is rendered twice, once under each media contract.

1. **Editorial Slab**
   - no OCR: wide cover hero with a lower overlapping fact slab;
   - OCR: poster and slab become adjacent; safe-cover is used only with an explicit safe flag and within budget.
2. **Split Canvas**
   - no OCR: stable 55/45 photo/information split;
   - OCR: media-column width follows `viewport height × source ratio`.
3. **Gallery Exhibition**
   - no OCR: vertical photo may fill the frame through cover;
   - OCR: the frame follows source ratio, minimizing side fields without cropping text.
4. **Typographic Lead**
   - no OCR: experiment for strong vertical imagery and a short/medium HTML title;
   - OCR: deterministic short-title branch only; otherwise fallback.

`Immersive Bottom Horizon` and `Billboard + Action Rail` are not carried forward. The former makes OCR/title contrast fragile; the latter spends useful canvas on a service rail and reintroduces the empty-field problem.

## Width and height acceptance

The stage is height-aware (`svh`) and title type scales against both `vw` and `vh`. Event titles wrap naturally; `line-clamp`, ellipsis and title overflow clipping are forbidden.

The primary QA matrix is based on the June 2026 Windows resolution distribution in the official [Steam Hardware & Software Survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=pc): `1920×1080` is `52.77%`, `2560×1440` is `22.04%`, `2560×1600` is `5.93%`, `3840×2160` is `5.02%`, `3440×1440` is `3.08%`, and `1366×768` is `2.33%`. Steam is a practical desktop proxy, not KenigEvents audience analytics.

Automated viewports:

- `1366×768` baseline low-height desktop;
- `1920×1080` dominant Full HD;
- `2560×1440` QHD;
- `3440×1440` ultrawide;
- `1440×650` and `1920×600` deliberate browser-window stress cases.

For every viewport:

1. all eight title boxes stay fully inside their stage;
2. page horizontal overflow is zero;
3. OCR `data-measured-crop <= 0.20`;
4. all mandatory actions remain present and accessible;
5. production mobile components and styles are absent from the diff.

## Promotion recommendation

Do not promote one desktop composition globally.

- no OCR: Editorial Slab for landscape/square; Split Canvas as the stable fallback; Gallery is allowed for strong vertical photos;
- OCR: Gallery for portrait, Split for other ratios; safe-cover is a source-grounded, measured optimization, never a default;
- Typographic Lead: only after the title gate and media-quality gate pass.

This lab changes only `/lab/event-desktop/`, its lab component and checks/docs. Production `EventHero.astro`, `EventLayout.astro` and the accepted mobile overlap geometry remain untouched.
