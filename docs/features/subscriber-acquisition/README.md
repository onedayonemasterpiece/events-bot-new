# Subscriber Acquisition

Canonical requirements: [requirements.md](requirements.md).

Discovery MVP design: [mvp-discovery.md](mvp-discovery.md).

Source materials: [source/](source/).

## Implementation entrypoints

Shadow-mode MVP scaffolding is implemented in `subscriber_acquisition/` and is
wired into the bot through `main_part2.py` as `/acq*` superadmin commands. Core
state is stored in Fly SQLite tables with SQLModel models in `models.py` and raw
bootstrap DDL in `db.py`. The import payload contract is documented in
[`schemas/acq_discovery_result.schema.json`](schemas/acq_discovery_result.schema.json).

The MVP is intentionally review-only: it may send Telegram messages only to
`ACQ_REVIEW_CHAT_ID` review chat and has guardrails against external Telegram/VK
posting. Kaggle/session wiring uses the existing heavy-job and S22 remote-session
controls; the scanner runtime is under `kaggle/SubscriberAcquisitionDiscovery/`.
